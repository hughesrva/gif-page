# gif-page

This is a page that allows the user to pull gifs from Giphy based on the topic they click. I have some pre-generated topics, but there is also an input box that pushes a new topic to the list of buttons at the user's request.

Gifs are pulled one at a time and clicking the gif will start or stop it.
